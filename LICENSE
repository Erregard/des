# Licensing and Usage

Several people have asked me about licensing issues, and whether it is possible to use this version of DES in a commercial or personal application. This page tries to answer that question, and also shows known places where this DES algorithm is being used.

# Licensing
The Javascript version of DES is based on a C version written and copyrighted by Eric Young as part of his SSL implementation. I went line by line through the C code, also following an in-depth description of the algorithm from another publication, and slowly built up the Javascript version. So as far as I am concerned the Javascript, Perl and PHP versions can be used in any way you would like, though I would like to be informed of any commercial usage. But I don't know if there are any other licensing implications. I would be very pleased if someone legally minded could [tell me](http://www.tero.co.uk/home/contact.php).

# Usage
I only started doing this in August 2008 so it's not complete. Please [send me](http://www.tero.co.uk/home/contact.php) any other uses you find.
